My Portfolio

Building my first web development portfolio.

First Epicodus Independent Project, 01.06.2017

## Description

This project is the first of my independent Epicodus projects. I built a web developer portfolio for myself using an HTML webpage that is styled using Bootstrap and my own CSS stylesheet. I included an about me section, a few goals, and attached links to some of my past work with descriptions.
